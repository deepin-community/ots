NAME
  ots - Open Text Summarizer

SYNOPSIS
  ots [OPTIONS] [file.txt | stdin]

DESCRIPTION
  The Open Text Summarizer is an open source tool for summarizing texts. The program reads a text and decides which sentences are important and which are not. OTS will create a short summary or will highlight the main ideas in the text.

  OTS is both a library and a command line tool. Word processors such as AbiWord and KWord can link to the library and summarize documents while the command line tool lets you summarize text on the console. The program can either print the summarized text as text or HTML. If in HTML, the important sentences are highlighted.

  -o, --out=FILE	Output FILE [default = stdout].

EXAMPLES
